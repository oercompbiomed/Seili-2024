# Odense Summer School in Computational Proteomics 2021
![Workflow](./assets/MSWorkflow2.png)

Odense – 2021 is part of the “Open Educational Resources in Computational Biomedicine” (OERCompBiomed) project conducted by NordBioMed.org and funded by Erasmus+.

NordBioMed is a collaborative network in the field of Biomedicine between the Universities of Turku, Eastern Finland (Kuopio), Bergen, Odense and Karolinska Institutet. The network was originally formed in 2013 to strengthen the individual biomedical teaching programs within the component universities and make them internationally more comparative by providing complementary activities from the partner universities. The network supports both student and teacher mobility, organizes intensive courses and develops a virtual online teaching and information platform on the OpenedX platform, supported by a GitHub repository. The topic for the 2021 Summer school is computational proteomics.

**The topic for the 2020 Summer school is computational proteomics. This year the course will virtual due to the current situation with COVID-19.**

### Learning aims:

Students will apply their previous knowledge to identify relevant and realistic topics/problems in the field of computational proteomics. In the workshops, students will work in groups of 4-5 students. 

### Before the Summer School

Please get familiar with the following material and platforms:

**Group work**<br/>
Here you will learn about getting most from the group work: https://rise.articulate.com/share/YOSU8I4BZjkJZK4_KUlIjcvBVzBMvs1x

**Basics in Proteomics**<br/>
Enroll into the "Computational Proteomics Course" (you need to sign up) and finish "Brush-up: The Basics of Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry"
The courses is located on our Open Edx platforms: http://training.bmb.sdu.dk/courses/course-v1:University_of_Southern_Denmark+SDU_BMB_COMPPROT+2020_1/about

**Python, R and friends:**<br>
A short introduction to programming and how to prepare yourself and
your computer for the computational exercises at the Summer School https://rise.articulate.com/share/Y-vw0ZckATqKqyh4u44c8p9YN-UEtr8r

Please also get familiar with the R programming language by attending the [Introduction in R](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) on DataCamp.

We expect you to have a working Jupyter environment with Python and R kernels.

**Online platform (potential)**
We will try out the AirMeet platform that allows a more conference-like environment and increased social interactions: link TBA
