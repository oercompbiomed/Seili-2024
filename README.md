# BalticSeaBioMed Summer School in Seili 2024

The Summer School on Human Health and Environment by the Baltic Sea in Seili is organised by the Nordic network BalticSeaBioMed, comprised of the Universities of Eastern Finland, Southern Denmark, Turku, Vilnius, Åbo Akademi University and Karolinska Institutet.

BalticSeaBioMed builds on the highly successful work of our founding network, NordBioMedNet, and makes an important innovative leap to bring state-of-the-art biomedical methodology into global health research. Here, we apply funding for a new Master's level intensive course to teach with new digi-pedagogical tools and focus on a new theme: the environmental impact of human behaviour. As an example and an educational “case study”, we will examine the effect of human use of pharmaceuticals and certain other harmful factors or changes on the Baltic Sea, and study them with modern biomedical omics technologies and large-scale data analysis using advanced computational methods. Our goal is to train the students in the skills and competencies required to solve complex problems of global health by using the challenges closer to us; the populations and well-being around the Baltic Sea as an example.

### Learning aims:  
Students will apply their previous knowledge to identify relevant and realistic topics/problems in the field of Biomedicine.  
Students will work in groups and each group is guided by a junior mentor.  
Based on the course material and guidance during the summer school, each group will develop and present a virtual preclinical research project to solve the selected problems.  
The final report/assignment will be prepared individually after the summer school.
